## What is charts?

Charts is a PHP (Laravel) library to handle all the charts in your application. It supports multiple
charting libraries and they allow to be loaded over AJAX with a nice loading animation.

It uses a simple API to create all the JS logic for you. You just need to write a few PHP lines :)
